### Controller

This is the core of a Correlated system. It accepts power for the network and processes the Enderspace connection. A network cannot function without this.

### Drive Bay

This connects all storage drives to the network for the controller to store coordinate positions to. A network cannot function without this and at least one storage drive. Insert storage drives by right-clicking on an empty slot with a storage drive, and right-click with an empty hand on a slot that has a storage drive to remove the drive. A Drive Bay can hold eight storage drives.

### Memory Bay

This connects all memory cards to the network for the controller to process coordinate positions with. A network cannot function without this and at least one memory card. Insert memory cards by right-clicking on an empty slot with a memory card, and right-click with an empty hand on a slot that has a memory card to remove the card. A Memory Bay can hold twelve memory cards.


### Terminal

A screen to access the network's Enderspace connection and all the items stored within. It is not mandatory for a functional network, but is recommended for general item access.

### Handheld Terminal

A portable, wireless screen to access the network's Enderspace connection and all the items stored within. It is not mandatory for a functional network, and requires any form of wireless connection to operate.

### Interface

This block will retrieve any amount of any items specified from the Enderspace connection and store the items in the physical world, so the items can be accessed by nearby inventories. Any items inserted into the interface that are not specified to be stored will be automatically added into the Enderspace connection.

### Wireless

Wireless systems can connect handheld terminals to networks or networks to other networks. A wireless network is connected together by its APN, or Access Point Name. To connect to a network from another network, right-click the controller and select the APN you wish to connect to.

There are three methods of transmitting wireless connections:
- Optical Transceivers are power-efficient but are short range and can only connect to systems in line of sight.
- Beacon Lenses are placed on top of active beacons, and can connect to anywhere within the beacon's range, even without line of sight. They will not obstruct the beacon beam, but will not work if the beam is blocked overhead.
- Microwave Beams have infinite range, but use a lot of power and only work within line of sight.
